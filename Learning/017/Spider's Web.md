Spider's Web
A spider is trying to build a web for itself. The web built by it doubles everyday.

If the spider completely built the web in 15 days, how many days did it take for the spider to build 25% of the web?

 Answer is a integer. Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity. Feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions 
 
 
 Given that the spider doubles its work everyday, lets figure out the amount of work done till 14th day ( a day before 15 days ).
Lets say the work done till 14th day is X. Since spider doubled the work done till 14th on 15th, on day 15th, Spider did X more work.

We know that 2X = 100% work.
Which means X = 50% work.

This means the spider built 50% of the web till the 14th day.
If you extend it, the spider did 25% of the work till 13th day.
