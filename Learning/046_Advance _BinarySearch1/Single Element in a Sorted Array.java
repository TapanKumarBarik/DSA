Problem Description

Given a sorted array of integers A where every element appears twice except for one element which appears once, find and return this single element that appears only once.

NOTE: Users are expected to solve this in O(log(N)) time.



Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 100000

1 <= A[i] <= 10^9



Input Format
The only argument given is the integer array A.



Output Format
Return the single element that appears only once.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = [1, 1, 7]
Input 2:

A = [2, 3, 3]


Example Output
Output 1:

 7
Output 2:

 2


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 7 appears once
Explanation 2:

 2 appears once






public class Solution {
    public int solve(int[] nums) {
        
             int left = 0, right = nums.length-1;
        while(left < right){
            int mid = (left + right)/2;
            if( (mid % 2 == 0 && nums[mid] == nums[mid +1]) || (mid %2 == 1 && nums[mid] == nums[mid - 1]) )
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                right = mid;
        }
        return nums[left];
    }
}
