Write a SQL Query to find those lowest duration movies along with the year, director's name(first and last name combined), actor's name(first and last name combined) and his/her role in that production.

Output Schema:

movie_title,movie_year,director_name,actor_name,role
NOTE:

Output column name has to match the given output schema.
Any name is the concatenation(without any delimiter) of first and last name if present
(E.g. if director_first_name is 'Alfred' and director_last_name is 'Hitchcock' then director_name is 'AlfredHitchcock')
Example Output:

movie_title,movie_year,director_name,actor_name,role
Vertigo,1958,AlfredHitchcock,JamesStewart,JohnFerguson
