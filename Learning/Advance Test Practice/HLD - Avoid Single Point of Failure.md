HLD - Avoid Single Point of Failure
To avoid a single point of failure in the application what would you deem best:

    Keep the data in multiple databases (example: MySQL, MongoDb)
    Keep the data in a cache and a database
    Replicate the data in multiple nodes of the same database
    Shard the data
    
    
    
    
      Replicate the data in multiple nodes of the same database
