## Sum of n natural  number=n(n+1)/2



## Sum of n natural whole number= n(n-1)/2

0,1,2,3,.....n-1 // as there are n numbers and start from 0 so last number is n-1;
  
  we know sum of n natural numbers =n(n+1)/2;

so applying same here
here n=n-1// last number
so 

(n-1)+(n-1+1)/2 
  => n(n-1)/2
